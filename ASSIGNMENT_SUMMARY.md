## 📋 Assignment Requirements Checklist

### ✅ Phase 1-3: Data Pipeline (COMPLETED)
- [x] GloVe embedding loading and caching (`src/embeddings.py`)
- [x] Tweet preprocessing and vectorization (`src/data_processing.py`) 
- [x] Exploratory data analysis (`src/eda.py`)

### ✅ Phase 4: Model Training (COMPLETED)
- [x] Systematic experimentation with multiple models
- [x] Hyperparameter tuning and optimization
- [x] Best model: SVM with RBF kernel (74.38% F1)

### ✅ Phase 5: Evaluation (COMPLETED)
- [x] **Confusion matrix analysis** → `final_evaluation/confusion_matrix.png`
- [x] **Misclassification examples** → Detailed analysis with 3 representative cases
- [x] Per-class performance metrics
- [x] Comprehensive evaluation report

### ✅ Phase 6: Reflection (COMPLETED)
- [x] **What worked well** → Systematic approach, GloVe effectiveness, SVM performance
- [x] **What didn't work** → Class imbalance, sarcasm detection, context limitations  
- [x] **Next steps** → Advanced architectures, data augmentation, production considerations

### ✅ Optional Bonus: Data Augmentation (COMPLETED)
- [x] **Synonym replacement implementation** → `experiments/data_augmentation.py`
- [x] **Performance comparison** → Baseline vs augmented results
- [x] **Analysis of results** → Impact assessment and insights
- [x] **Critical insight discovered** → Simple synonym replacement can degrade performance due to context loss

**Key Learning**: The experiment revealed that naive synonym replacement (e.g., "Do" → "bash") introduces noise rather than helpful variation, demonstrating the importance of data augmentation quality over quantity.

## 📊 Key Performance Metrics

| Metric | Score | Interpretation |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Weighted F1** | **74.38%** | Excellent for CPU-friendly models |
| **Accuracy** | 73.57% | Strong overall performance |
| **Macro F1** | 68.67% | Good considering class imbalance |

### Per-Class Performance:
- **Negative**: 81.88% F1 (strongest class)
- **Positive**: 64.11% F1 (decent performance) 
- **Neutral**: 60.01% F1 (most challenging)

## 🔍 Error Analysis Highlights

### Most Common Misclassification Patterns:
1. **Negative → Neutral (36.4% of errors)**: Factual complaints without emotional language
2. **Negative → Positive (18.5% of errors)**: Sarcasm and irony detection failures
3. **Neutral → Negative (17.7% of errors)**: Technical issues perceived as complaints

### Representative Examples:
- **Challenging Case**: "When will the flight resume? :/" (neutral labeled as negative)
- **Sarcasm Failure**: "you always surprise me with the awfulness" (negative labeled as positive)
- **Technical Confusion**: IT issues reported neutrally but classified as negative
